## Introduction
Welcome to my Recipe Organizer project! In a world where culinary exploration is increasingly popular, organizing and managing your recipes efficiently can make all the difference. Whether you're a seasoned chef, a cooking enthusiast, or simply someone who enjoys experimenting in the kitchen, my Recipe Organizer offers a solution to simplify the process of storing, categorizing, and accessing your favorite recipes.

## Problem statement
Effective recipe management can be difficult, particularly if you have a big collection. It is difficult for users to efficiently organize, locate, and retrieve recipes. Difficulties include the inability to locate particular recipes, ineffective storage, a lack of options for categorization,  and the laborious human entering of recipe data.

## Solution statement
I suggest an application called Recipe Organizer to deal with these issues. 

A centralized SQLite database for recipe data storage, an easy-to-use interface for browsing and searching recipes, options for categorization and filtering, customization options.

By streamlining recipe management, this app hopes to make it simpler for users to find and savor their favorite recipes.

## Features
1. Store recipe information including ingredients, instructions, and categories in a centralized SQLite database.

2. Categorization and Filtering - Allow users to categorize recipes by cuisine type, meal type, dietary preferences.

3. An easy-to-use interface for browsing and searching recipes by id and title.
 
4. Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
